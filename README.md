## Frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

### Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React DOM**: A package that provides DOM-specific methods for React.
- **Tailwind**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest

npm audit fix --force 

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize.

## Backend

The backend for this project is yet to be added.
